# Making Music with the Web Audio API

Code and examples from Steve's talk at JSConf Colombia 2023.

## Colophon

The site that hosts these examples uses [SvelteKit](https://svelte.kit.dev) and is styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). The face tracking for the **Face Theremin** project uses a library called [`face-api.js`](https://npm.im/face-api.js).

## Older Versions
